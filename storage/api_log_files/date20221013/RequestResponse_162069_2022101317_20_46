Having the most beautiful and the cleanest shores of the Mediterranean, along with the long coastal line of Antalya, one encounters antique sites, old ports, monumental graves, dramatic shores, endless beaches, green forests, rivers and waterfalls.\nKaleici, enclosed in ancient city walls, is Antalya’s Old Quarter. It is one of the liveliest parts in the city with shops, bars, restaurants and entertainment facilities. The streets of Kaleici extend to the old harbour, which is used as an international yacht marina today. In the picturesque Old Quarter, you’ll find examples of Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Seljuk and Ottoman eras and numerous archaeological cities and historic buildings to explore.\nAntalya is an attractive city with shady palm-lined boulevards, considered by many as a paradise on earth and the pearl of the Mediterranean. Not bad, huh?\n"}
