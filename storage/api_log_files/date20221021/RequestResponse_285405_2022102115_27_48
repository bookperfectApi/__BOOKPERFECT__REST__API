Nicknamed the Entertainment Capital of the World or Sin City, it is situated in the Mojave Desert and is surrounded by dry mountains. Las Vegas is famous worldwide for its consolidated casinoâ€“hotels and associated entertainment. The city houses many mega-hotel complexes decorated with lavish care and attention to detail creating a fantasy-like environment. All hotels have a unique style, there are special sights everywhere, and every hotel has its own casino. Most of the hotel casinos are in the city's downtown area, along The Las Vegas Strip. The Strip is a world of its own. Where else can you go to visit Egypt, New York, Venice, Disneyland, Hollywood, and much more all on one street? The fact is that all the action that Las Vegas is famous for is happening on this one and only street. Bellagio could be considered unofficial centre of the Strip, one of the reasons being the free displays of musical fountains which go off at every half an hour with different choreography accompanied by different music. Bellagio is one of the more stylish venues with a superb flower garden and for those with gourmet inclinations, it offers arguably one of the best buffets in town. The Venetian is another point where one might linger longer due to its fabulous attempt of recreating Venice in the desert. The main square of Venice is filled with gondolas ply the waters channels and opera singers entertain their captive audience on board.  The opposite end of the Strip is closest to the airport starting with the funny rendition of Egypt with its Luxor casino despite the fact that there are no pyramids in Luxor, but everything is possible in Las Vegas."}
