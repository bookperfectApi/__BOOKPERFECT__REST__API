Few experiences can compare with cycling the Grachtengordel, the girdle of canals that radiate south from Central Station that are lined with a crazy quilt of narrow residences dating from the city's Golden Age. While motor vehicles customarily blight the cityscapes of other European capitals, a constant flow of bicycles seem only to enhance Amsterdam’s beauty. Enter an alternate universe where non-motorised transport is the norm, every bridge and thoroughfare features a bike lane and motorists customarily defer to their two-wheeled counterparts. Amsterdam remains a global crossroads and an ever-vibrant centre of art, music and culture, with a never-ending cavalcade of exhibitions, concerts, plays and festivals. Aside from such monoliths of art as the Rijks and Van Gogh museums, there are myriad less-visited spaces on quirkier themes. The festival line-up is equally varied, devoted to everything from fringe theatre to minimal music to tattoos, and in late summer the renowned canals become the stage for a series of chamber music concerts. Revelry is at its peak on King’s Day, a birthday party for the King This is when the capital is clad in patriotic orange, the canals brim with party boats and the city turns into a huge flea market as everyone empties their closets on the pavement and hawks their clutter."}
